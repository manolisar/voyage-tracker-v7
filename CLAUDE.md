# Voyage Tracker v7 — Project Charter

> Engineering log for the **Celebrity Solstice-class** (5 ships).
> Replaces v6 (`~/Projects/Voyage_Tracker_v6`, single-ship, local-file storage).

## 1. What this app is

A static SPA used by ECR / Chief Engineers / Bridge OOWs to log fuel + lub-oil consumption per cruise leg. Data is written as **plain JSON files to a per-ship network folder** (e.g. `Z:\voyage-tracker\solstice\`) via the browser's **File System Access API**. No backend, no cloud, no database — the app is a static bundle hosted on GitHub Pages that reads and writes the ship's own network share directly. Every save stamps a `loggedBy` attribution block (name + role + timestamp); access control is the Windows/SMB share ACL (see §4).

**Fleet (all Solstice-class, identical engine/boiler plant):**

| Code | Ship                  | Built |
|------|-----------------------|-------|
| SL   | Celebrity Solstice    | 2008  |
| EQ   | Celebrity Equinox     | 2009  |
| EC   | Celebrity Eclipse     | 2010  |
| SI   | Celebrity Silhouette  | 2011  |
| RF   | Celebrity Reflection  | 2012  |

## 2. Tech stack

- **React 19** + **Vite 7**
- **Tailwind CSS 4** (CSS-first config; theme tokens in `src/styles/app.css`)
- **File System Access API** for storage (per-ship network folder; handles persisted in IndexedDB)
- **IndexedDB** for: directory handles, session (`shipId`/`userName`/`role`), draft cache
- Deployment: GitHub Pages (static)

No backend. No database. No serverless functions. No auth servers. The entire app is a static bundle that writes JSON files to the ECR PC's mapped network drive.

**Browser requirement:** Chromium-based (Chrome, Edge, Brave). The File System Access API is not supported in Firefox or Safari; the landing screen detects this and shows a clear "use Chrome or Edge" message instead of crashing.

---

## 3. Storage model

Each ship owns a folder on its own network share. The crew selects that folder once per PC (via `showDirectoryPicker`) and the browser remembers the handle in IndexedDB — subsequent launches just re-request permission silently.

**Per-ship folder layout:**
```
Z:\voyage-tracker\solstice\
├── SL_2026-01-15_MIA-FLL.json
├── SL_2026-02-04_FLL-CZM.json
└── …
```

**File naming:** `<SHIP_CODE>_<voyageStartDate>_<fromPort>-<toPort>.json` — e.g. `SL_2026-01-15_MIA-FLL.json` (Celebrity Solstice, Miami → Fort Lauderdale). Ship codes are the `code` field in [public/ships.json](public/ships.json) (`SL`, `EQ`, `EC`, `SI`, `RF`). Port codes are the 3-letter suffix of the UN/LOCODE (e.g. `USMIA` → `MIA`); the full LOCODE + country + display name are preserved inside the voyage body so the filename's truncation to 3 letters never loses context.

**File contents:** the voyage JSON plus a `loggedBy` block written on every save. `fromPort` / `toPort` are full objects, not bare strings:

```json
{
  "startDate": "2026-01-15",
  "fromPort": { "code": "MIA", "name": "Miami",           "country": "US", "locode": "USMIA" },
  "toPort":   { "code": "FLL", "name": "Fort Lauderdale", "country": "US", "locode": "USFLL" },
  "…": "…",
  "loggedBy": {
    "name": "M. Archontakis",
    "role": "Chief",
    "at": "2026-04-19T08:14:22.113Z"
  }
}
```

**Port catalog:** the UN/LOCODE-derived catalog lives at [public/ports.json](public/ports.json), built once from the open DataHub UN/LOCODE dump by [scripts/build-ports-catalog.mjs](scripts/build-ports-catalog.mjs) (re-run manually when UN/LOCODE refreshes). The New Voyage modal autocompletes against it via [src/components/ui/PortCombobox.jsx](src/components/ui/PortCombobox.jsx); if the user types an unknown 3-letter code the combobox prompts for name + country inline and persists the entry to IndexedDB under `customPorts/<shipId>` so it shows up in future autocompletes for that ship.

**Adapter contract:** the storage layer lives at `src/storage/local/` and exposes `listVoyages`, `loadVoyage`, `saveVoyage`, `deleteVoyage`, `upsertIndex`. The rest of the app depends on the interface (`src/storage/adapter.js`), not the backend.

**Stale-file check (the minimal safety net):**
Simultaneous edits to the same file are rare (three roles own mostly disjoint fields — see §4) but not impossible. Instead of full conflict resolution:

1. On load, we remember `file.lastModified` for each voyage.
2. Before every write, we re-fetch `file.lastModified` from disk.
3. If it's newer than what we loaded, we pause the save and surface `<StaleFileModal>` with **Reload from disk** / **Overwrite anyway** / **Cancel**.

This is cheap (one `getFile()` call, no full read) and catches the only realistic overlap case on a LAN share. There are no SHAs, no version vectors, no retries.

**Offline fallback:** if the network drive is unreachable (`NotFoundError` / `NotReadableError`), the save is cached in IndexedDB (`src/storage/indexeddb.js`) and flushed on the next successful permission grant.

---

## 4. Access model — "The network share is the boundary"

The data is **not secret** (it's not PII or financial — just fuel counters). Access control is handled by the Windows/SMB ACL on the ship's `voyage-tracker\` share; anyone who can mount the drive can edit the data. Inside the app there is **no PIN, no password, no login, no PAT** — the landing screen asks for ship + name + role purely to stamp `loggedBy` on each save for attribution.

### Landing flow (3 steps, one-time per PC)

1. **Pick ship** — 5 tiles for the Solstice-class fleet.
2. **Identify** — type your name, pick your role (dropdown).
3. **Folder** — pick the ship's network folder (first time) or reconnect (on reload).

The `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` is stored in IndexedDB (the `handles` object store, keyed by `shipId`). On reload, Chromium auto-grants permission for persisted handles so the picker is skipped; if it reverts to "prompt" state, the landing screen offers a one-click "Reconnect folder" button.

### Edit Mode

A one-click toggle in the top bar flips between **View Only** (default on open) and **Edit Mode**. It exists purely to prevent stray clicks from a passerby at an unlocked ECR PC — it is **not** a security boundary. No PIN unlocks it; the Windows lock screen does the real access control.

### Role partition (who writes what, by convention)

| Role                    | `role` value | Typical writes                                           |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Chief Engineer          | `chief`      | Amends anything, closes voyages (End Voyage + lub-oil).  |
| 2nd Engineer (ECR)      | `second`     | Creates voyages, writes Departure / Arrival fuel data.   |
| Bridge Officer of Watch | `bridge`     | Writes per-leg Voyage Report (times, distance, speed).   |
| Other                   | `other`      | Fallback for cadets/relief crew.                         |

Stored role values are the lowercase enum from [`src/domain/constants.js`](src/domain/constants.js) (`EDITOR_ROLES`). The capitalized human labels (`EDITOR_ROLE_LABELS`) are only for display — the TopBar renders the first word of the label (e.g. "Chief") next to the user's name.

Nothing in the app enforces these partitions — they're workflow convention. Any role can write any field; the `loggedBy` stamp on each save records who did it. That's the audit trail.

## 5. Equipment & fuel rules (Solstice-class)

| Equipment | Default fuel | Allowed fuels        | Locked? |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| DG 1-2    | HFO          | HFO / MGO / LSFO     | no      |
| DG 4      | HFO          | HFO / MGO / LSFO     | no      |
| DG 3      | MGO          | MGO / LSFO           | no      |
| Boiler 1  | MGO          | MGO only             | **yes** |
| Boiler 2  | MGO          | MGO only             | **yes** |

**Default densities:** HFO 0.92, MGO 0.83, LSFO 0.92 (editable per-voyage).

**Lub-oil:** recorded **only** at End Voyage (one entry per voyage), NOT in departure/arrival reports.

This is data-driven via `public/ship-classes/solstice-class.json` so adding a new ship class later = drop a new JSON file.

---

## 6. UI architecture

**Layout:** persistent left tree + right detail pane (CSS Grid).

```
TopBar:  [☰] Voyage Tracker — Celebrity Solstice    [● Edit Mode | View Only]  [Enable Edit] [?] [⚙] [🌙] [⇦]

┌─ Sidebar (tree) ─────────┬─ Detail Pane ──────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔍 Search               │                                                │
│  [Active][Ended][All]    │   Selected node renders here:                  │
│                          │   • VoyageDetail (cruise card + densities      │
│  ▾ MIA-NAS-MIA           │     + summary + Legs list)                     │
│    📋 Voyage Detail      │   • ReportDetail (Departure/Arrival form)      │
│    ▾ Leg 1               │   • VoyageReportDetail (End Voyage summary     │
│      📤 Departure        │     incl. lub-oil)                             │
│      📥 Arrival          │                                                │
│    ▾ Leg 2               │                                                │
│      📤 Departure        │                                                │
│      📥 Arrival          │                                                │
│    📊 Voyage Report      │                                                │
└──────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tree hierarchy:**
- Voyage
  - 📋 Voyage Detail (always present)
  - Leg 1, 2, 3, …
    - 📤 Departure Report
    - 📥 Arrival Report
  - 📊 Voyage Report (only after End Voyage)

**No `LegDetail` node** — clicking a leg expands it; the actual detail nodes are Departure/Arrival underneath.

**Independent pane scrolling:** `html, body { overflow: hidden }`, root flex with `min-h-0` on grid children. Sidebar scrolls independently of detail; detail scrolls independently of sidebar.

**Mobile:** sidebar becomes a drawer below 900 px.

**Keyboard nav:** arrow keys, Enter, Home/End, `/` to focus search, Ctrl+B to toggle sidebar, Esc to close modals.

## 7. Visual design — Signal Flag Bands theme

Carried from v6, refined.

- **Fonts:** Manrope (UI) + IBM Plex Mono (numerics)
- **Color-coded category cards:** fuel (deep navy `#0F172A`), water (blue), chemicals (pink), lube (orange). Fuel bar is a single solid navy — NOT a tri-color HFO/MGO/LSFO gradient — so the card reads as a single surface even when three fuels are present inside.
- **Edit Mode badge:** amber pill in top bar
- **View Only badge:** muted gray pill
- **Buttons:** `btn-primary` (blue), `btn-warning` (amber for End Voyage / Enable Edit)

### Stratified dashboard motif (report-form summary cards)

Every `.cat-card` renders in three strata, top-down:

1. **8px top bar** (`::after` pseudo-element) — solid per-variant color (navy for fuel, `--color-water-band` for water, etc.). The pennant identity lives here.
2. **Title strip** — `.cat-label` painted with `--color-surface2` (an opaque cool off-white rail). Separates the top bar from the body with a subtle bottom border.
3. **Tinted body** — the tint (`rgba(<variant-rgb>, 0.035–0.05)`) lives on `.cat-card` itself, NOT on `.cat-body`. This is load-bearing: cards in the same CSS grid row inherit the tallest sibling's height, and the card-level tint fills that height so short cards (e.g. single-input Fresh Water Bunkered next to three-row Fuel R.O.B.) aren't half-white.

Interaction: `translateY(-3px)` hover lift + `0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` shadow, mount `@keyframes slideUp` with staggered 80ms delays on `.grid > .cat-card:nth-child(N)`. All motion is auto-disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` via the global rule at the top of `app.css`.

Σ Total column on the report-totals card uses `.fuel-col-sigma` (centered, pill-shaped, cyan-tinted gradient) — the first three columns keep the HFO/MGO/LSFO category colors.

### View ↔ edit parity (no two implementations of the same form)

`ReportForm` and `VoyageReportSection` both accept a `readOnly` prop. In read-only mode, each `<input>` is swapped for a static div with `background: transparent; border: 1px solid transparent` — same box model, same typography, same grid layout. The detail-pane wrappers (`ReportDetail`, `VoyageReportDetail`) are 20-line components that render the edit component with `readOnly`. This guarantees toggling Edit Mode doesn't reflow the page and means a single component owns the visual contract for each form.

### Dark mode

Via CSS variable redefinition in `.dark` (architectural, not per-element overrides). Tokens defined:
- Surface: `--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-surface2`
- Text: `--color-text`, `--color-dim`, `--color-faint`
- Borders: `--color-border-subtle`
- State: `--color-error-{bg,fg}`, `--color-warn-{bg,fg}`
- Landing gradient: `--color-landing-bg-{from,mid,to}`

Fuel-bar color flips to `#CBD5E1` (chalk) in dark mode so it stays legible against the navy surface. Toggle persists in localStorage; respects `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit.

---

## 8. Mockup is the visual spec (partially superseded)

**`mockup/index.html`** was the Phase 1 sign-off artifact for layout, typography, color, and the tree/detail pane interaction model — it remains the canonical reference for the visible surface of the app.

What the mockup still defines:
- Main layout (tree + detail + top bar, independent pane scrolling, dark mode).
- All forms: `ReportForm` (5 equipment rows × 2 phases), `VoyageReportSection` (lub-oil), `CruiseSummary`.
- Creation modals: New Voyage, Add Leg, End Voyage.

What the mockup has **superseded** by the local-file pivot:
- **Landing screen** — the mockup shows a PIN + role picker; real app asks for ship + name + role + folder (no PIN).
- **Edit Mode overlay** — the mockup gates Edit Mode behind a PIN entry modal; real app is a one-click toggle.
- **Admin Panel** — gone. Replaced by a plain **Settings** modal (`SettingsPanel`) with Change-folder / Export / Import / Switch-ship.
- **Conflict modal** — replaced by **`StaleFileModal`** with mtime-drift semantics (Reload from disk / Overwrite anyway / Cancel).

**Implementation MUST match the mockup's structure, copy, spacing, color choices, and interaction patterns for the surfaces that weren't superseded.** When in doubt, ask before diverging.

---

## 9. Reuse from v6

Carried over (refactored to read equipment from class config instead of hardcoded keys):

- `src/domain/factories.js`, `calculations.js`, `validation.js`, `constants.js`
- `src/components/voyage/ReportForm.jsx`, `PhaseSection.jsx`, `EquipmentRow.jsx`, `CruiseSummary.jsx`, `VoyageReportSection.jsx`
- Creation modals under `src/components/modals/` (New Voyage, Add Leg, End Voyage)
- `Icons.jsx` (extended with Anchor, Cloud, Folder, Download, Upload, etc.)
- `app.css` (Signal Flag Bands theme)
- `ThemeContext`, `ToastContext`

**Verification:** re-enter 3 v6 sample voyages in v7, fuel totals (HFO/MGO/LSFO MT) must match v6 to 0.01.

## 11. Build phases

1. ~~**Mockup**~~ — DONE.
2. ~~**Scaffold + v6 domain carry-over**~~ — DONE.
3. ~~**Tree UI + forms + creation modals**~~ — DONE (GitHub-backed first cut).
4. ~~**Local-file pivot**~~ — DONE. Replaced GitHub/PAT/PIN model with File System Access API + per-ship network folder + `loggedBy` attribution.
5. **One-shot data migration** — pull each ship's voyages from the old `voyage-tracker-data` repo, bundle them per ship, hand the bundles to crew for first-launch import via Settings → Import. Then archive the data repo.
6. **Deploy polish** — Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95, GitHub Pages deploy smoke test on a Windows PC with a mapped network drive.

---

## 12. Operating principles

- **No code changes for new ships of the same class** — drop an entry in `ships.json`, that's it.
- **No code changes for cosmetic data tweaks** — densities, phase labels, etc. all live in class config JSON.
- **No backend, ever** — this is now literally true. No PATs, no API keys, no auth servers. The app only talks to the local filesystem via the File System Access API.
- **The mockup is the visual contract** — see §8 for the surfaces it still governs and the ones that have been superseded by the local-file pivot.
- **Attribution lives in `loggedBy`** — every voyage file carries the `{ name, role, at }` of whoever last saved it. There is no git-based audit log; the on-disk file *is* the record. Ship IT is responsible for backing up the network share.

*Last updated: 2026-04-19. Maintained alongside `mockup/index.html` — visual surfaces must stay in sync; behavior-level deviations documented in §8.*
